# Intro
To help you analyze Snowflake's usage patterns and monitor your cost, Snowly needs some information about the way you use your Snowflake account. For example: what type of queries you typically runs, at what times and by whom.

No actual data (i.e. from your data tables) is being shared with Snowly. Only information about the use of Snowflake is being shared. For example: query execution times, utilization of warehouses etc.

# Install 2
## What does the installation script do?
1. Create a new database for the shared information
2. Create a process (stored procedure) to keep the information updated
3. Make sure that the updating process is running regularly (scheduled)
4. Establish a Snowflake data-sharing


## Got it. Let's do this.

### Create a new database
This script requires ACCOUNTADMIN ROLE in order to create a Share and read from "SNOWFLAKE" internal database
```sql
USE role ACCOUNTADMIN;
```

Create a new database to be shared later using SnowShare
```sql
Create database SHARE_USAGE ;
Use database SHARE_USAGE;
Create Schema ACCOUNT_USAGE;
USE Schema ACCOUNT_USAGE;

```

### Create s stored procedure
The full script can be found [here](/SP_ACCOUNT_USAGE_DATA.md)
This is the object that will be created
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE SHARE_USAGE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.SP_ACCOUNT_USAGE_DATA(LOAD_METHOD STRING)
RETURNS STRING
LANGUAGE javascript
strict
EXECUTE AS owner
AS
$$ 
.... 
``` 
[Full Create Script](/SP_ACCOUNT_USAGE_DATA.md)


### Run Once
Execute the procedure above to create the tables and load the data
```sql
call SHARE_USAGE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.SP_ACCOUNT_USAGE_DATA('FULL');
```


### Schedule task to update the tables 

*NOTE: it is recommended to create a separate Warehouse to monitor the cost of the sync
```sql
CREATE WAREHOUSE WH_SNOWLY WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL' WAREHOUSE_TYPE = 'STANDARD' AUTO_SUSPEND = 60 AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;
```
This task will be executed every 8 hours at 04:00, 12:00 and 20:00 UTC
```sql
  --CREATE TASK
  create or replace task SHARE_USAGE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TASK_ACCOUNT_USAGE
  warehouse = WH_SNOWLY
  schedule = 'using cron 0 4,12,20 * * * UTC'
    as
  call SHARE_USAGE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.SP_ACCOUNT_USAGE_DATA('');
```

Activate the Task
```sql
--ACTIVATE TASK
  ALTER TASK SHARE_USAGE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TASK_ACCOUNT_USAGE  RESUME;
```

</div>

## Share
Up until now, no data was shared

### Create a Snowflake data sharing

```sql
set add_comment= CONCAT(current_account(),' | ',  current_region());

CREATE SHARE SHARE_USAGE_SH COMMENT=$add_comment ;
grant usage on database  SHARE_USAGE  to share SHARE_USAGE_SH;
```

### Share with Snowly Snowflake account
Data sharing is availble only between same regions.
Supported regions are:

| Cloud | Region | Snowly Account | NAME |
|-|-|-|-|
| AWS | US-EAST-1 | CH52627 | US East (N. Virginia) |
| AWS | EU-CENTRAL-1 | YA21808 | EU (Frankfurt) |
| AWS | EU-WEST-1 | HB37582 | EU (Ireland) |
| AZURE | EAST-US-2 | XL70015 | East US 2 (Virginia) |
| AZURE | WEST-EUROPE | VISIONBI | West Europe (Netherlands) |
| GCP |  |  |Comming Soon... |

Share Data
```sql
ALTER SHARE SHARE_USAGE_SH ADD ACCOUNTS = <ACCOUNT_NAME>;
```
Example
```sql
-- FOR AWS US-EAST:
ALTER SHARE SHARE_USAGE_SH ADD ACCOUNTS = CH52627;
```

### Grant permissions
Last step - grant permissions to the Share
```sql
grant usage on schema SHARE_USAGE.ACCOUNT_USAGE to share SHARE_USAGE_SH;
grant select on all tables in schema SHARE_USAGE.ACCOUNT_USAGE to share SHARE_USAGE_SH;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA SHARE_USAGE.ACCOUNT_USAGE TO SHARE SHARE_USAGE_SH;
GRANT SELECT ON VIEW SHARE_USAGE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.DATABASE_STORAGE_USAGE_HISTORY TO SHARE SHARE_USAGE_SH;
GRANT SELECT ON VIEW SHARE_USAGE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY TO SHARE SHARE_USAGE_SH;
GRANT SELECT ON VIEW SHARE_USAGE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.STORAGE_USAGE TO SHARE SHARE_USAGE_SH;
GRANT SELECT ON VIEW SHARE_USAGE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS TO SHARE SHARE_USAGE_SH;
GRANT SELECT ON VIEW SHARE_USAGE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY TO SHARE SHARE_USAGE_SH;
GRANT SELECT ON VIEW SHARE_USAGE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.PIPE_USAGE_HISTORY TO SHARE SHARE_USAGE_SH;
GRANT SELECT ON VIEW SHARE_USAGE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.LOGIN_HISTORY TO SHARE SHARE_USAGE_SH;
GRANT SELECT ON VIEW SHARE_USAGE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.CLOUD_SERVICES_WO_WAREHOUSE_SIZE TO SHARE SHARE_USAGE_SH;
GRANT SELECT ON VIEW SHARE_USAGE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.META_DATA_CHANGES TO SHARE SHARE_USAGE_SH;
```
